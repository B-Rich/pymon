This script is a very simple call monitor for Fritz!Boxes. It connects
to the router's callmonitor service and displays a notification via
pynotify on incoming and outgoing calls. It also looks up the caller's
name using KlickTel and displays the name and address of the remote
party if available. If no entry is found, only the number is
displayed.

Instructions:

1. Dial #96*5* on your phone to activate the box' callmonitor service.
2. Set the hostname of the box in pymon.py if necessary.
3. Start pymon.py.
4. ????
5. PROFIT!!!

If you encounter any bugs (I'm sure there are quite a few :), please
submit a bug report on GitHub.
